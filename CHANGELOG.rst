Major Changes
-------------

- Bumping `dependencies` of ansible.netcommon to `>=8.1.0`, since previous versions of the dependency had compatibility issues with `ansible-core>=2.19`.

Bugfixes
--------

=======

Bugfixes
--------

v10.0.0
=======

Release Summary
---------------

With this release, the minimum required version of `ansible-core` for this collection is `2.16.0`. The last version known to be compatible with `ansible-core` versions below `2.16` is v9.2.0.

Major Changes
-------------

- Bumping `requires_ansible` to `>=2.16.0`, since previous ansible-core versions are EoL now.

v9.2.0
======

Minor Changes
-------------

- Add ios_evpn_ethernet resource module.

Deprecated Features
-------------------

- ios_vlans - deprecate mtu, please use ios_interfaces to configure mtu to the interface where vlans is applied.

Bugfixes
--------

- ios_logging_global - Fixed issue where cisco.ios.logging_global module was not showing idempotent behaviour when trap was set to informational.
